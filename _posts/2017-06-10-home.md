Over the last decades an incredible amount of resources has been devoted to
building ever more powerful supercomputers. However, exploiting the full
capabilities of these machines is becoming exponentially more difficult with
each new generation of hardware. To help understand and optimize the behavior
of massively parallel simulations the performance analysis community has
created a wide range of tools and APIs to collect performance data, such as
flop counts, network traffic or cache behavior at the largest scale. However,
this success has created a new challenge, as the resulting data is far too
large and too complex to be analyzed in a straightforward manner. Therefore,
new automatic analysis and visualization approaches must be developed to allow
application developers to intuitively understand the multiple, interdependent
effects that their algorithmic choices have on the final performance.

This workshop will bring together researchers from the fields of performance
analysis and visualization to discuss new approaches of applying visualization
and visual analytics techniques to large scale applications.

### Workshop Topics

- Scalable displays of performance data
- Data models to enable scalable visualization
- Graph representation of unstructured performance data
- Presentation of high-dimensional data
- Visual correlations between multiple data source
- Human-Computer Interfaces for exploring performance data
- Multi-scale representations of performance data for visual exploration
