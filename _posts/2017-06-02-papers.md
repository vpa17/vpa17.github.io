## Call for Papers

We solicit 8-page full papers as well as 4-page short papers that
focus on techniques at the intersection of performance analysis and
visualization, and either use visualization techniques to display large scale
performance data or that develop new visualization or visual analytics methods
that help create new insights.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format (readable by Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0
